The R package `redbookperu` provides convenient access to the information contained in the [Red Book of Endemic Plants of Peru](https://revistasinvestigacion.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/rpb/issue/view/153). This book represents a comprehensive compilation of data on Peru's endemic plant species, encompassing records of 5,508 distinct taxa. Although this document marked a milestone by consolidating an ambitious initiative focused on understanding the diversity of Peru's endemic plant species at the time of its publication, it currently requires a review and update of the presented taxonomic information.

The process of accessing data from the original publication can pose challenges for researchers, particularly due to the large number of taxa presented within it. The `redbookperu` package has the primary objective of addressing these challenges by providing updated taxonomic information. Additionally, it introduces functions designed to enhance the accessibility and usefulness of the data presented in the Red Book of Endemic Plants of Peru.

The information included in the `redbookperu` package is built with the support of the [Taxonomic Name Resolution Service TNRS](https://tnrs.biendata.org/), in collaboration with the [World Checklist of Vascular Plants WCVP](https://powo.science.kew.org/about-wcvp) database. These resources are utilized to ensure the validity and standardization of the taxonomic information that we provide.

### Installation

You can install the ppendemic package from CRAN using:

```r
install.packages("redbookperu")

# or

pak::pak("redbookperu")
```

You can install the development version of `redbookperu` from GitHub:

```r
pak::pak("PaulESantos/redbookperu")
```

### Getting Started

After installing the `redbookperu` package, you can load it into your R session using:

```{r}
library(redbookperu)
```

To determine if a species of interest is listed in the Red Book of Endemic Plants of Peru, we provide the `check_redbook()` function. This function verifies whether the species of interest is included in the book's species list. The function comes in two variations:

- `check_redbook(splist, tax_status == TRUE)`: The resulting information is structured as follows: "species name" - "taxonomic status" - "validation information".
  - Species Name: Provides the currently accepted name for the species.
  - Taxonomic Status: Includes the following categories: "Accepted name" when the           species name recorded remains valid currently, "Updated name" for species whose         scientific name recorded at the time of publication is now considered synonymous,       "No opinion" for species whose name presents difficulties in determining their          current taxonomic status, and "Non info. available" for species for which updated       information hasn't been found in the WCVP database. When the species of interest        doesn't match the species list, the response is "Not endemic".
  
```{r}

splist <- c("Aphelandra cuscoenses", "Sanchezia capitata",
            "Sanchezia ovata", "Piper stevensi",
            "Verbesina andinaa", "Verbesina andina", "Weinmania nubigena")

check_redbook(splist, tax_status = TRUE)
```

- `check_redbook(splist, tax_status == FALSE)`: The result indicates whether the species is endemic or not, based on its match with the species present in the database.

```{r}
check_redbook(splist, tax_status = FALSE)
```


Both functions indicate the presence of partial matches (fuzzy match) when the name of the species of interest varies compared to the information present in the database.


`check_redbook()` function is designed to work seamlessly with tibbles, allowing users to easily analyze species data within a tabular format.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tibble::tibble(splist = splist) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(endemic_tax_status = check_redbook(splist, tax_status = TRUE),
                endemic = check_redbook(splist, tax_status = FALSE))
```

```r
# A tibble: 7 Ã— 3
  splist                endemic_tax_status                                  endemic              
  <chr>                 <chr>                                               <chr>                
1 Aphelandra cuscoenses Aphelandra cuscoensis - Accepted name - Fuzzy match Endemic - fuzzy match
2 Sanchezia capitata    Sanchezia ovata - Updated name                      Endemic              
3 Sanchezia ovata       Sanchezia ovata - Accepted name                     Endemic              
4 Piper stevensi        Piper stevensii - No opinion - Fuzzy match          Endemic - fuzzy match
5 Verbesina andinaa     Verbesina andina - No info. available - Fuzzy match Endemic - fuzzy match
6 Verbesina andina      Verbesina andina - No info. available               Endemic              
7 Weinmania nubigena    Weinmania nubigena - Not endemic                    Not endemic   
```


If you intend to access the information provided for each of the species listed in the Red Book of Endemic Plants of Peru, you have the option to use the `get_redbook_data()` function. This function facilitates the association of updated taxonomic information with the details concerning conservation status, distribution, and descriptions presented in the original publication.


```{r}
get_redbook_data(c("Sanchecia capitata",
                   "Weinmania nubigena",
                   "Macroclinium christensonii",
                   "Weberbauera violacea"))

```
