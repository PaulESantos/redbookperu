The R package `redbookperu` provides convenient access to the information contained in the [Red Book of Endemic Plants of Peru](https://revistasinvestigacion.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/rpb/issue/view/153). This book represents a comprehensive compilation of data on Peru's endemic plant species, encompassing records of 5,507 distinct taxa. Although this document marked a milestone by consolidating an ambitious initiative focused on understanding the diversity of Peru's endemic plant species at the time of its publication, it currently requires a review and update of the presented taxonomic information.

The process of accessing data from the original publication can pose challenges for researchers, particularly due to the large number of taxa presented within it. The `redbookperu` package has the primary objective of addressing these challenges by providing updated taxonomic information. Additionally, it introduces functions designed to enhance the accessibility and usefulness of the data presented in the Red Book of Endemic Plants of Peru.

The information included in the `redbookperu` package is built with the support of the [Taxonomic Name Resolution Service TNRS](https://tnrs.biendata.org/), in collaboration with the [World Checklist of Vascular Plants WCVP](https://powo.science.kew.org/about-wcvp) database. These resources are utilized to ensure the validity and standardization of the taxonomic information that we provide.

### Installation

You can install the `redbookperu` package from CRAN using:

```r
install.packages("redbookperu")

# or

pak::pak("redbookperu")
```

You can install the development version of `redbookperu` from GitHub:

```r
pak::pak("PaulESantos/redbookperu")
```

### Getting Started

After installing the `redbookperu` package, you can load it into your R session using:

```{r}
library(redbookperu)
```

To determine if a species of interest is listed in the Red Book of Endemic Plants of Peru, we provide the `check_redbooklist()` function. This function verifies whether the species of interest is included in the book's species list.When the species of interest doesn't match the species list, the response is "Not endemic".
  
```{r}

splist <- c("Aphelandra cuscoenses", 
            "Sanchezia capitata",
            "Sanchezia ovata", 
            "Piper stevensi",
            "Verbesina andinaa", 
            "Verbesina andina", 
            "Weinmania nubigena")

redbookperu::check_redbooklist(splist, dist = 0.2)
```


Function indicate the presence of partial matches (fuzzy match) when the name of the species of interest varies compared to the information present in the database.


`check_redbooklist()` function is designed to work seamlessly with tibble, allowing users to easily analyze species data within a tabular format.

```{r }
tibble::tibble(splist = splist) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(endemic = redbookperu::check_redbooklist(splist,
                                                         dist = 0.2))
```

If you intend to access the information provided for each of the species listed in the Red Book of Endemic Plants of Peru, you have the option to use the `get_redbook_data()` function. This function facilitates the association of updated taxonomic information with the details concerning conservation status, distribution, and descriptions presented in the original publication.


```{r}
redbookperu::get_redbook_data(c("Sanchecia capitata",
                   "Weinmania nubigena",
                   "Macroclinium christensonii",
                   "Weberbauera violacea"), 
                   dist = 0.2)

```
### Note: 
The code for the new version of the `redbookperu` package is based on the [`lcvplants`](https://idiv-biodiversity.github.io/lcvplants/) package, with modifications specifically tailored to work with the data from the Red Book of Endemic Plants of Peru.
